This directory contains a template set of LaTeX files for producing
Aston University dissertations and thesis.

The main master documents is "thesis.tex". This loads in a preamble
document which sets up the LaTeX environment and then includes the
other LaTeX files corresponding to the different sections. The
"thesis.bib" file is the Bibtex
bibliography file which you should add your references should be added to 


In order to use this template you may need to download some extra font (for
Libertine font) and macro packages for your LaTeX environment. The "tikz"
package is used to enable embedding of figures in LaTex. This is
particularly good for block diagrams, state machines etc.
