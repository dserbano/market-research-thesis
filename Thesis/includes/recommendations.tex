\chapter{Recommendations}

 Any actions recommended to meet the original purpose. As with the
 conclusions, each recommendation should be brief and self-contained,
 presented in a logical order with no surprises.

If this is written well, readers will anticipate the recommendations
from the conclusions and you may number them so they link back to the
relevant conclusion. Possibly use so that clauses: {\em Do this so
  that XX results \ldots}.
