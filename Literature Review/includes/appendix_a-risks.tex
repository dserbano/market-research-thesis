\chapter{Risks Analysis}

\textsl{This chapter lists the potential risks that may affect the project and the methodology used for their management. Risks are controlled through the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}  
	\item Identification: all potential risks are identified;
	\item Analysis: the possible consequences of each risk are studied, in order to understand the danger they pose to the project;
	\item Planning: methods are established to prevent the risks or to correct them;
	\item Control: at every iteration of the project, the impact of risks is assessed.
\end{enumerate}
The following information is provided for each risk:
\begin{itemize}  
	\item Name: what the risk is;
	\item Description: what the risk consists of;
	\item Danger: the level of danger the risk poses to the project (low, medium or high respectively);
	\item Consequences: the possible negative outcomes that result from the risky event manifesting;
	\item Corrective actions: the possible steps to take in order to prevent the risk from manifesting or correct its consequences. 
\end{itemize}}

	\textbf{Consequences} & \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\arabic*.), itemjoin={\newline}]
		\item Wasting time;
		\item Missing the deadlines;
		\item Poor extensibility;
		\item Implementation issues;
		\item Integration issues.
	\end{enumerate*} \\
	\textbf{Corrective actions} & A longer period of time was allocated during the feasibility study in order to compare different tools according to the following parameters:
